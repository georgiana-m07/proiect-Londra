# London Travel Agency Project

This project was developed as part of a group assignment for a university course, where we acted as a fictional travel agency specializing in tours and travel arrangements for London. Each team member was responsible for creating a specific page, showcasing different aspects of London's attractions, accommodations, and services for tourists.

## Project Overview

The website offers a detailed guide to traveling in London, including:

- **Attractions**: Information on iconic landmarks and historical sites.
- **Accommodations**: A guide to various types of lodging in London, from hotels to budget-friendly stays.
- **Entertainment**: A curated list of events and activities that tourists can enjoy during their stay.
- **Dining**: A selection of top restaurants and local food experiences.
- **Shopping**: Where to find the best shopping districts in the city.
- **Transportation**: Tips on navigating Londonâ€™s public transport and other options.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for structuring and styling the content.
- **JavaScript** for enhancing user interaction and functionality.
- **Bootstrap Framework** to ensure a responsive, mobile-first design.
- **Sass** for organizing and simplifying the CSS code.

The project is structured into multiple HTML pages, each covering a different aspect of the London travel experience. Each section was developed with a focus on clarity, usability, and aesthetics, using basic web development technologies to ensure that the site is accessible and responsive on different devices.
